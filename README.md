Most of these patches can go inside any folder inside your game data folder, it is recommended to keep such patches in a personal folder.

A few may require to be specifically in a "Zorg" folder or need to have paths/module manager oeprators changed if you move them. Such configs make a note of it inside the comments in the file. As above, please check the comments before using a particular patch.
