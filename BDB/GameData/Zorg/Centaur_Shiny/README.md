# Textures Unlimited for BDB.

I use TU for a shiny Centaur G/T and D1T.

Since there needs to be a none shiny D1 in addition to the bare metal D1T, a copy of the Centaur D1 tank model needs to be placed into a folder and a +PART copy of the tank needs to reference the copied model. The TU config also needs to point to this model. Please see the sample config (models not included) in the gamedate folder.
