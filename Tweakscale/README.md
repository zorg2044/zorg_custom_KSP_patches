# ReDirect tweakscale

Adds tweakscale to som parts.

#WARNING

Tweakscale has had issues with save corruption if more than one tweakscale patch targets the same part. The newer versions detect and warn the users about this. These patches should be removed if official support is added within tweakscale or the mods own compatibility patches.
