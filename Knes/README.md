# KNES

## Cryo
LH2 configs to work with cryo tanks. Ariane 5 is tricky since the core is overscaled. Using 50% IRL thrust for vulcain instead of the usual 25%.

## Thrust nerf

Separate thrust nerf to bring upper stages to 25% IRL thrust instead of standard 50%. Some upper stages get 37.5% just to keep burn times similar to IRL.

# solids
Add thrust curves. Adjust thrust for a couple. Add ability to shut down the small upper stage ones. (but not restart). Ariane 5 booster is rebalanced in the LH2 config. Still WIP. Most radial booster solids dont have thrust curves yet.
