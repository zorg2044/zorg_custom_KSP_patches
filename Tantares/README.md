The energia LH2 is quite safe although It probably needs a rebalance in line with Nfrealism rules

Need to redo Soyuz rescale (uses B9 to cosmetically switch new Soyuz 1.25m parts to 1.5m). That will be submitted to Beale for inclusion in the near future. Some parts are added as new parts (decoupler etc) others will have their model replaced (upper stage engine for one.). This is very WIP.
