# zorg_custom_KSP_patches
This folder contains configs meant for the DX11 development fork of KS3P. This is a fork on which DX11 shaders meant for KS3P v6 were developed on my Jrodriguez. This fork only works with DX11 and these configs are meant only for this version. They will likely work with KS3P v5.x but are not optmized for that version.

It is also reccomended to use a sunlight boosting config to increase the contrast in the game for a more realistic hard light look in space. A patch for JNSQ is included here (it multiplies the sunlight intensity curve by 1.3x). The Lightfixer mod is an alternative for other planet packs or visual packs. Lightfixer does not use curves and just straight up multiplies the sunlight value. I dont know how it looks in practice.
