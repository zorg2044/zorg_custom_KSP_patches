# ReDirect tweakscale

Adds tweakscale to some (but not all) ReDirect parts.

#WARNING

Tweakscale has had issues with save corruption if more than one tweakscale patch targets the same part. The newer versions detect and warn the users about this. This patch should be removed if official support is added within tweakscale or ReDirect compatibility patches.
